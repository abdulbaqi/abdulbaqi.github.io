Here is my first post. I am excited to begin what I see a long journey. I am thankful to a number of internet blogging technology out there. If you are curious, here is what I did to arrange for this blog.

- I registered my domain name (abdulbaqi.io) through Amazon AWS. 
- Then, I hosted my site through GitHub pages and created CNAME to point to my domain name. 
- I used Jekyll static blogging techniques to tidy up things and stay stree-less which managing the blog. 
- [Beautiful Jekyll theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) was very helpful to get me started.
