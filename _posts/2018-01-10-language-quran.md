Language is a unique human faculty. The Quran throws lots of insights on the nature of this faculty. Employing the Quran in the quest to learn about the origins and mystics of language is a very powerful approach. It is so because, first, language is an inner mystery available only to the human race, so we can not run laboratory experiments on rats and discover insights about language in human, because rats has not language faculty.

A disclaimer is that errors could creep in various forms.
