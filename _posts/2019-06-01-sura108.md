In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.
## 1. We have given you plenty.
We have given you O Muhammad plenty of things in this world and the Hereafter. Among them are the Quran and prophethood and kept a special river for you in paradise. 
## 2. So pray to your Lord and sacrifice.
As I gave you plenty in both worlds be sincere to your Lord while performing your obligatory and voluntary prayers and worship Him alone and slaughter your sacrificial animal in His name alone without associating any partners with Him. The Prophet â€“ as such- used to pray the Eid prayer and then slaughter his sacrificial beast. 
## 3. He who hates you is the loser.
Those who hate you O Muhammad and hate the message that you came with, which contains clear proofs and plain truths are the ones who are the losers, and their mention is cut off. The infidels of Quraiysh thought when no sons of Prophet survived that eventually, no one will carry his name. To the contrary, Allah has made the mention of Prophet Muhammad above all mentions and made his message manifest over all message till the day of Judgement, May peace and blessings of Allah be upon Prophet Muhammad.
