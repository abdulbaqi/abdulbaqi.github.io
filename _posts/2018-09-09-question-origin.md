Allah has created this Universe for human beings. The first human was Adam. Allah created Adam by His hands from clay, and created from Adam the first women Eve. All things in heaven and earth were made for the offspring of Adam and Eve. All these bounties bestowed to us in exchange to worship Allah.

Under this monotheistic narrative, the position of man is ranked very high. Man feels proud to enjoy the gift Allah gave us. 

Biologists, however, tend to paint a very dismal picture of the origin of human beings. According to them, in prehistoric times probably more than 6 million years ago we were part of great ape family. 

>"A single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our own grandmother."

Thus *Yuval Noah Harari* wants us to believe in his much acclaimed bestseller *Sapiens*.

According to our modern biological version, since the first *homo* on earth probably some 6 million years ago, human gradually got smarter than apes and evolved through ape-like *homo* genus until about 70,000 years back when a very smart species called *homo sapiens* with big brains emerged from Africa and started to scribe a bold signature on this planet.  

Comparing apes and human on physical grounds -like brain size, or walking upright- is an insult to the cognitive and intellectual properties they differ from each other. 

The problem is the lack of physical evidences at our hand. Everything then has to rest on conjectures and hypothesis. However, people like Harari force forward all these conjectures as definitive truth and start arrogantly to make fun on anyone who does not agree with him. It is a modern form of intellectual dictatorship. 

That is the polite way to handle Harari. However, if I want to be nasty with him, then -perhaps without departing much from truth- I would brand him among the clan of various Jews who's sole objective throughout history is to create chaos and spread misinformation to turn the public (all non-Jewish nations) into donkey-like herds breaking away with norms and traditions. Illuminati and Freemasonry are much popular, but there remains hundreds coveted groups which Harari must be a member of some.

Allah has mentioned in 5:64

>And the Jews say, "The hand of Allah is chained." Chained are their hands, and cursed are they for what they say.. And We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it. **And they strive throughout the land corruption,** and Allah does not like corrupters.


Here is a succinct narrative which Harari does not want to hear and would have made lots of fun out of it. 

We do not trace our lineage to a primitive animal: chimpanzee or fish. Rather we proud ourselves to be offspring of Adam -the first man and a noble prophet- whom Allah created by His own hand. 

Adam was a completely human being with full cognitive and intellectual power. Allah taught him names of everything that are physical or mental. From day one Adam engaged in religion worshiping Allah alone. 

After the fall, Adam and Eve produced offspring. They formed society that were as complicated as ours in terms of various social dynamism. There were all kind of jealousy, love, hatred, etc. There are agriculture as well as hunting and cattle herding. In physical terms, human race started to advance in discovery of tools and sciences, but in intellectual and meta-physical term, they were as intelligent as us and they were fit to practice religion (which is considered the highest form of intellectual capability) as we do. 

The biggest problem with Harari -and all science people who are atheists- is the complete denial of the unseen. Their logic goes as follows: if you can not show me something physically, then it does not exist. God, jinn, paradise, hell, angels, demon are all myth. 

Quran 30:7

>They know what is apparent of the worldly life, but they, of the Hereafter, are unaware.
