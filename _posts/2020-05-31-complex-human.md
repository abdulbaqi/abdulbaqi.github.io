The greatest gift of God to Muslims is the Quran. The gift of the Quran is not limited to its text but the divine guarantee to keep that text intact from getting corrupted and mixed with man-made amendments. The Torah and Gospel were also divine texts, except that filthy hands went into adding dangerous amendments. Amendments that came at a high price.
Among such fabricated biblical stories, is the story of David and Bathsheba. Here we see how the noble King and Prophet David is concocting a [cunning plot](https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-stories/david-and-bathsheba.html) to marry Bathsheba after getting rid of her husband. Such a story found the perfect ground to germinate among the right-wing fascist groups who thought never mind Bathsheba as long as Goliath is been checked. The script is notoriously the same: there is an enemy, and there is a chosen group set on a mission to get rid of that enemy, and in between everything -no matter how horrible- is forgiven.

Recently I just finished watching the Netflix documentary called [The Family](https://www.netflix.com/title/80063867). Here we find the secret Christian elite fellowship who organizes the annual national prayer breakfast. Their idea is to reach to power through a Jesus wolf not a Jesus lamb. That is why they liked David the King. Their World Order is a Christian mission disguised under a narrative of the "Chosen" white anglo-Saxon people. Their founder is Abraham Vereide who came from Norway and after his death Douglas Coe advance the cause of the group. Their ultimate objective is to gain power and richness and their favorite model is that of Hitler and Mafia. Their rules are simple two: stay secret, and use the name of Jesus. 

High profile sex scandals are very much tolerated within this elite group and comfort and justification has always been found in the story of David and Bathsheba. Search for example scandal of John Ensign (Nevada) or Mark Sanford (North Carolina). They are OK to shake hands with the most authoritarian and dictator regimes on earth as long as that guarantees a steady flow of money and richness. 
They have found in Trump their much sought Wolf King. No matter what sex scandal is leaked in the past or would be leaking in the future about Trump, the Bible and Bathsheba would come and save Trump as it saved David.

All men are equally accountable in the eyes of God. Prophet Muhammad, Jesus or David all feared Allah and knew this fact very well. They were the noblest and the most righteous among mankind. The Power and Kingship that David got was a gift from God and made him only more humble, grateful, and never a tyrant or a dictator. Similarly, Prophet Muhammad would spend the night praying and offering gratitude to Allah till his feet would swell. On the second coming of Jesus, he would rule the earth and establish justice and equality, not like these capitalist Wolf Kings of today who would use the name of Jesus to rob nations of their resources and to fill the coffers of the rich few.

This false David and Bathsheba story found followers not only among the Christian Evangelicals and Machiavellians but with any movement who has the concept of a "Chosen One". I was watching with interest the newly released docuseries on Netflix called ["Who Killed Malcolm X"](https://www.netflix.com/title/80217478). There you would find that blind follower of Elija Muhammad who when asked, "didn't it bother you that Elija Muhammad illegally fathered teenage girls?". Lo and behold, the answer came,(I am paraphrasing) "Does it bother you as a Christian that David would plot the killing of his friend to marry his wife?"
Peace and blessings of Allah be on Prophet Muhammad who said, "Never over-revere me as the Christians over-revered Jesus. I am only a servant of Allah, so just say Muhammad is His servant and Messenger".

We read in chapter 19:95 of the Quran, **"And all of them are coming to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone."** Everyone will have to face Allah alone, and Allah will hold everyone accountable. There will be a scale of justice. The good deeds will go to the right and the bad deeds to the left. Read for example Quran 21:47 **"And We place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul will be treated unjustly at all. And if there is [even] the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth. And sufficient are We as an accountant."**

On the day of judgment, people would rush to noble prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses asking to approach Allah and seek His favor, no one would dare to approach Allah and every great prophet would say, "My soul, My soul".

Is there a place for the narrative of "the Chosen One" after all these?

I end with quoting the inherent Jeudo-Christian problem of the "chosen one" syndrome, which is pretty eloquently narrated in Quran 5:18.

> But the Jews and the Christians say, "We are the children of Allah and His beloved." Say, "Then why does He punish you for your sins?" Rather, you are human beings from among those He has created. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and to Him is the [final] destination.
