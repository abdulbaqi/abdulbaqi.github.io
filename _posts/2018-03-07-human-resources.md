Natural resource and human resources; these two are often postulated as the economic pillars for any country. Here I would like to emphasis that human resources is the main pillar and much more important. There could be two countries equal in natural resources, but still one is poor and the other is rich. The reason is the quality of human resource is better in one and not so good in the other. Also, there could be two countries; one rich in natural resources, and the other poor in natural resources, yet we can see the first is poor and the second is rich. Here again the distinguishing factor was not the natural resources, but the quality of human resources. 

It is clear then that human resource is the most important prosperity factor in any economy. But what is the secret behind a human being, that makes him superior to gold, silver, fossil fuel and any other natural resources in this world?

It is the ration, the free will, and -before this and that- the Godly gifts that Allah bestowed on human kind. 

Human being out of his freedom, always *thinks* and *does*. This dual gifts from the **Creator** of the mankind IS the secret of our success. 

Our imagination and thoughts know no limits. The infant opens up imagination on tricks to get mom's milk. The toddler opens up imagination to nag dad for yet another toy. The teenager opens up imaginations to romance his girl. The list goes until the dictator opens up imaginations to spread fear and terror among his population and perpetuate his rule. 

Such imaginations lead way to actions. People went deep to dive to ocean beds, and took long journey to moon. These all started with imaginations and thoughts. 

Allah has created in our psyche a number of attractions that are the basic ingredients of these imaginations. Attraction to the opposite sex (that guarantees the sustainability of human race on earth), and the attraction to money and property (that guarantees economic progress and innovation on earth). Man is in exam while he is on earth. These attractions and the freedom of thinking and acting provides rich material for tests on this earth. Allah never left us to be subject of test without providing us material to study and pass these exams. Prophets and messengers were kind professors who delivered not only books and pamphlets as study materials but were sincere and lead a life full of sacrifice and dedication to lead us to the right path. 

The real quest of mankind's thirst in not the water, nor the oxygen that he breaths, it is the spirituality and submission to Allah. When these enormous energies of human being in governed by the spirituality, only then you would expect from such quality human resources to build ideal civilization on earth. 

After Prophet Muhammad left this world, his companions and their companions were such a society that proved to the world what human resource means, and what an ideal civilization mean. Through the touches of their magical wands, whichever city and land they went to, the indigenous population turned 180 degrees and embraced Islam and started to build the greatest civilization on earth. All facets of human development flourished and all sustainable development goals were achieved. 

Contrast this with the mentality of plunder and extraction which the European powers demonstrated when they visited other lands. Their outlook of human resources were just to enslave the local population and use them in the extraction of gold and silver from mines or use them for sugar plantation in faraway lands.
