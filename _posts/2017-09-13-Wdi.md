The purpose of this post is to give a hands-on demo on how to fetch data from World Bank's famous [World Development Indicators](https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators) using a very handy [`wbdata`](http://wbdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package from python. Also, along this tutorial, you will get to know some regular expression usage in python, and how we can improve the `matplotlib` charting library with `seaborn` package. 

First, let us install the library `wbdata`.


```
!pip install wbdata
```

Then import the library as usual.


```
import wbdata
```

Actually this package can connect to lots of data sources maintained by World Bank. We can view these data sources as follows. 


```
wbdata.get_source()
```

We are interested in source no. 2. This source contains thousands of indicators, so how can we search them by keyword. Here is the way. 

```
wbdata.search_indicators('emission', source=2)

    NY.ADJ.DPEM.CD      	Adjusted savings: particulate emission damage (current US$)


As you can see, the function returns a list of indicator names and their codes. Let us choose the indicator with title `CO2 emissions (kg per 2011 PPP $ of GDP)` and code `EN.ATM.CO2E.PP.GD.KD`

We can get details of a particular indicator by knowing its code number as follows. 

```
ind = wbdata.get_indicator('EN.ATM.CO2E.PP.GD.KD', display=False)
```

When you specify `display=False` then you enable the output to be kept in a variable (in our case it is `ind`), which we can easily display as below. 

```
ind
```


    [{'id': 'EN.ATM.CO2E.PP.GD.KD',
      'name': 'CO2 emissions (kg per 2011 PPP $ of GDP)',
      'source': {'id': '2', 'value': 'World Development Indicators'},
      'sourceNote': 'Carbon dioxide emissions are those stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement. They include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and gas flaring.',
      'sourceOrganization': 'Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, United States.',
      'topics': [{'id': '19', 'value': 'Climate Change'},
       {'id': '6', 'value': 'Environment '}]}]



As you can see, this function returns the value as a dictionary, from which we can extract desired information. Let us say we want to know the name of the indicator.


```
ind[0]['name']
```




    'CO2 emissions (kg per 2011 PPP $ of GDP)'



After we found the indicator, let us choose a number of countries to investigate. For that let us search for country codes.


```
wbdata.search_countries("Bangladesh")
```

    BGD	Bangladesh



```
wbdata.search_countries("Saudi")
```

    SAU	Saudi Arabia


We now have indicator code and country codes, all we need now is two dates to narrow our search. Let us say that we want to search the database from 2001 to 2015. Here is the way we keep the two dates.


```
import datetime
data_dates = (datetime.datetime(2001,1,1), datetime.datetime(2015,1,1))
```

By now we have all the ingredients, all we need now is to call the most important function: `get_dataframe` to fetch the data and keep it inside a dataframe.


```python
import pandas as pd
data = wbdata.get_dataframe({'EN.ATM.CO2E.PP.GD.KD':'values'}, 
                            country=('BGD', 'SAU'), 
                            data_date=data_dates, 
                            convert_date=False, keep_levels=True)
```


```
data.head()
```




<div>
<style>
    .dataframe thead tr:only-child th {
        text-align: right;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: left;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
      <th>values</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>country</th>
      <th>date</th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="5" valign="top">Bangladesh</th>
      <th>2015</th>
      <td>NaN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2014</th>
      <td>NaN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2013</th>
      <td>0.154309</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2012</th>
      <td>0.160099</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2011</th>
      <td>0.160661</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



It seems the dataframe is indexed twice: country-wise as well as date-wise. I am not very comfortable in dealing with multi-indexed dataframes, so I would feel better to `reset_index` so that I can apply filters more conveniently.


```
data = data.reset_index()
```

Now, let us see few lines of the dataframe after resetting index. 

```
data.head()
```




<div>
<style>
    .dataframe thead tr:only-child th {
        text-align: right;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: left;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>country</th>
      <th>date</th>
      <th>values</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Bangladesh</td>
      <td>2015</td>
      <td>NaN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Bangladesh</td>
      <td>2014</td>
      <td>NaN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Bangladesh</td>
      <td>2013</td>
      <td>0.154309</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Bangladesh</td>
      <td>2012</td>
      <td>0.160099</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Bangladesh</td>
      <td>2011</td>
      <td>0.160661</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



After this proof of concept, let us wrap up these small bits and pieces into a function that will take a country, an indicator ID and start and end dates and return a list which can be used to plot charts later.


```python
def country_data(country_code, indicator, start=2000, end=2015):
    import datetime
    import wbdata
    data_dates = (datetime.datetime(start,1,1), datetime.datetime(end,1,1))
    #call the api
    data = wbdata.get_dataframe({indicator:'indicator'}, 
                                country=country_code, 
                                data_date=data_dates, 
                                convert_date=True, 
                                keep_levels=False)
    
    data = data.reset_index()
    #data = data.dropna() #if I want I can drop the na's
    return data[['indicator']]
```

And a small test to check things are running well. 

```
country_data('IDN','EN.ATM.CO2E.PP.GD.KD')
```




<div>
<style>
    .dataframe thead tr:only-child th {
        text-align: right;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: left;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>indicator</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>NaN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>NaN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>0.197236</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>0.260391</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>0.264045</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>5</th>
      <td>0.209629</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>6</th>
      <td>0.231842</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>7</th>
      <td>0.226354</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>8</th>
      <td>0.216339</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>9</th>
      <td>0.211427</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>10</th>
      <td>0.221036</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>11</th>
      <td>0.230642</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>12</th>
      <td>0.227291</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>13</th>
      <td>0.230597</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>14</th>
      <td>0.231680</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>15</th>
      <td>0.214482</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



Now it is time to write a grand function that takes as input a list of country codes, then uses our function above `country_data` to get a list of indicators for each country, then plot a line diagram.


```python
def plot_indicators(country_list, indicator, start=2000, end=2015):
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    import wbdata
    import re
    ind = wbdata.get_indicator(indicator, display=False)
    # capture the title which includes the unit after bracket
    title = ind[0]['name']
    # now take entire text from first letter to before opening bracket
    title = title[:title.find('(')-1]
    # this is the patter to match anything between two brackets
    p = re.compile('\((.*?)\)')
    ylab = p.findall(ind[0]['name'])[0]
    sns.set_style('white')
    fig, axis = plt.subplots()
    for c in country_list:
        axis.plot(range(start,end+1),country_data(c,indicator,start,end))
    plt.legend(country_list)
    plt.title(title)
    plt.ylabel(ylab)
    plt.show()
```

Let us test the function with gulf countries: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and U.A.E since 1990.


```
plot_indicators(['SAU', 'QAT', 'BHR', 'KWT', 'OMN', 'ARE'],
	'EN.ATM.CO2E.PP.GD.KD',1990,2015)
```


![png](/img/output_34_0.png)


There are few points to illustrate in the function above.

First, note that -in order to render better chart- I have used [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) data visualization package which basically sits on top of `matplotlib`. I just `set_style` our chart to one of seaborn's styles for better output but the `matplotlib` commands remains the same. 

Second, I had to extract from the title of the indicator the unit which sits in between parenthesis. To do that I used regular expression. So, let me explain this point further.

You saw above how I got the name of the indicator which returned something like `GDP per unit of energy use (constant 2011 PPP $ per kg of oil equivalent)`

Note that the name of all World Bank indicators starts with the actual title of the indicator, followed by the unit in between parenthesis. So, how we can extract these two parts. 

Let us start with the first part which is easier. We want to start taking string subset from position 0 until we see the first opening bracket, that would be our title part. In order to do that, I used strings `find()` function as follows.


```
test_string = 'GDP per unit of energy use (constant 2011 PPP $ per kg of oil equivalent)'
test_string[:test_string.find('(')-1]
```




    'GDP per unit of energy use'



`find` returns be the position of `'('`, so I take the string from position 0 to position of open bracket minus one (because the last character before bracket is a space which I want to ignore). 

Now, the more difficult part is the unit which sits in between brackets. I could have used the same `find()` to search for index of closing bracket. But let me use regular expression so practice this powerful tool. 

First we need to import regular expression package `re`. Then we need to design the pattern we are interested in which is *anything in between open and close parenthesis*. That is: `'\((.*?)\)'`. Check this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2403122/regular-expression-to-extract-text-between-square-brackets) post to get more information. I am using `findall()` function to return a list of all instances, and then I take the first instance of the list (at position 0). 


```python
import re
p = re.compile('\((.*?)\)')
p.findall('GDP per unit of energy use (constant 2011 PPP $ per kg of oil equivalent)')[0]
```




    'constant 2011 PPP $ per kg of oil equivalent'



With these separation between title and unit, we can easily incorporate them in the `ylabel` and `title` of our `matplotlib` charts as done in our function above: `plot_indicators`.

With this, I hope you can carry-on on your own with much more interesting queries and experiments.
