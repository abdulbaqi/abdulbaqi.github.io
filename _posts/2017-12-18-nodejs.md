[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a backend javascript engine. [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a lightweight web framework that sits on top of Nodejs. In this post, I am going to go build a [RESTful](https://gist.github.com/alexpchin/09939db6f81d654af06b) app talking steps at a time. Down the road, I will use [Semantic-UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) as a `CSS` alternative to `Bootstrap`. I am going to use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database engine.

The App should allow users to enter name of a mosque, its image and a short description. The user can update and delete entered information later. So, let us get started!

## Installation

I have a mac, and homebrew did everything for me. I assume you will manage with your own environment. Googling and little bit of patience will solve all problems. Stackoverflow community will be able to address your particular issues. Make sure that when type `node -v` you get a version number, which assures you that you are ready to go. 

### initialize npm

Create a directory `mosques`. 

```
baqi:udemy abaqi$ mkdir mosques
baqi:udemy abaqi$ cd mosques
```

Now initialize `npm`. A wizard will take you through few options and result in a `package.json` file for you in the directory. 

```
baqi:mosques abaqi$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg> --save` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

Is this ok? (yes) 
baqi:mosques abaqi$ 
```

Now, install `express`:
```
npm i express --save
```

The `--save` above will append the express in the dependency list of the `package.json` file.

  }
}
```

## app.js : the first version

The bare minimum is:

1. get the express framework
2. create a route
3. make the app run on a port

Here is how it looks. 

#### app.js

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function(req,res){
	res.send('..just the first step in a 1000 mile journey..');
});

app.listen(3000,function(){
	console.log('server started on port 3000..');
})
```

And here is how to run it:
```
baqi:mosques abaqi$ node app.js 
server started on port 3000..
```

Then go to your browser and open up: `http://localhost:3000/`.

![gdp per capita](/img/nodejs/1.png){: .center-image}
*figure 1: First skeleton*

You can always `ctrl+c` in the terminal to stop the app.

## templates

Instead of getting result through `res.send()`, we want to use templates. To do that we need to create a folder called `views` and create the template file inside it. Let us call it `index.ejs`. Node files must have `ejs` extension. Inside it we will have normal `html` codes. 

```
baqi:mosques abaqi$ mkdir views
baqi:mosques abaqi$ touch views/index.ejs
```
In order for express to serve templates we have to install `ejs` module from `npm`.

```
npm install ejs --save
```

Here is about first template.

#### index.ejs

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Mosques around the World</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Houses of Allah</h1>

<p>This Site will list amazing photoes of mosques around the world. Stay tuned!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, go to your `app.js` and change the 'req.send(...)' to `req.render('index.ejs')`.

#### app.js

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function(req,res){
	res.render('index.ejs');
});

app.listen(3000,function(){
	console.log('server started on port 3000..');
})
```

### view engine

One small enhancement: over time you might get bored by typing `ejs` file extension every time in the `req.render` function. 

All you need is to insert `app.set('view engine', 'ejs');` in your app.js file, and then get rid of `.ejs` every time. Here is the updated app.js

#### app.js

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

app.get('/', function(req,res){
	res.render('index');
});

app.listen(3000,function(){
	console.log('server started on port 3000..');
})
```

Now, go and restart the app. (that means first `ctrl+c` to stop the app if running, then run again through `node app.js`). Here is the shape of our app so far.

*figure 2: incorporating ejs templates*

### RESTful routes

It is good practice to follow the following routing convention.

| **URL** | **HTTP Verb** |  **Action**|
|------------|-------------|------------|
| /mosques/         | GET       | index  
| /mosques/new         | GET       | new   
| /mosques          | POST      | create   
| /mosques/:id      | GET       | show       
| /mosques/:id/edit | GET       | edit       
| /mosques/:id      | PATCH/PUT | update    
| /mosques/:id      | DELETE    | destroy  

Let us pick the first route, i.e., `/mosques`. It means when I point to this url, it should render the index.ejs templates we just have created. and when user visits the `/` path it should `redirect` me to the `/mosques` path.

![gdp per capita](/img/nodejs/3.png){: .center-image}
*figure 3: the /mosques route*

```javascript
app.get('/', function(req,res){
	res.redirect('/mosques');
});

app.get('/mosques', function(req,res){
	res.render('index');
});
```

Next, the `/mosques/new` route should lead me to a template (which is not yet created) called `new.ejs`, and so on, I should have `show.ejs` and `edit.ejs` for the routes `/mosques/:id` and `/mosques/:id/edit` respectively.

```javascript
app.get('/mosques/new', function(req,res){
	res.render('new');
});

app.get('/mosques/:id', function(req,res){
	res.render('show', {id:req.params.id});
});

app.get('/mosques/:id/edit', function(req,res){
	res.render('edit',{id:req.params.id});
});
```

The html verb that are not `get` will not have their own template, and will spend more time with them later. 

Here are rendering of these files in the browser with just a placeholders for the time being.

![gdp per capita](/img/nodejs/4-new.png){: .center-image}
*figure 4: the /mosques/new route*

![gdp per capita](/img/nodejs/5-show.png){: .center-image}
*figure 5: the /mosques/:id show route*

![gdp per capita](/img/nodejs/6-edit.png){: .center-image}
*figure 6: the /mosques/:id/edit route*

### Mystery of `:id`

`:` allows us to pass parameters within the requested url. Each mosque will have an id in our future `mongoDB` database. So, when we visit the url `/mosques/123endb34nd`, our app will show detailed information about the mosque which has id of `123endb34nd`.

The way to grab that id from url is through `req.params.id` as we will see later. 

Here is the `show.ejs` file and note how I am grabbing the id in the template using the ejs way `<%=id%>`.

#### show.ejs

```html
<h1>Mosque Information</h1>

<p> Here you will see a form to show detailed 
information about the mosque with id <%=id%>
</p>
```

### Partials 

The various ejs files entails us to have partials of header and footer, where we can move common stuff there and have our ejs files just include them. In this way we save much time and have less pain when modifying things. 

Here are the `header.ejs` and `footer.ejs` files saved inside `views/partials` folder.

```
baqi:mosques abaqi$ mkdir views/partials
baqi:mosques abaqi$ touch views/partials/header.ejs
baqi:mosques abaqi$ touch views/partials/footer.ejs
```

#### header.ejs

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Mosques around the World</title>
</head>
<body>
```

#### footer.ejs

```html
Copyright 2017
</body>
</html>
```

All we need is to include these files in our rest of the files. Here is an example from `index.ejs`

#### index.ejs

```html
<% include ./partials/header %>
<h1>Houses of Allah</h1>

<p>This Site will list amazing photoes of mosques around the world. Stay tuned!</p>

<% include ./partials/footer %>
``` 

### Semantic-UI

Let us give some sleek look to our site by using [Semantic-UI](https://semantic-ui.com/). We will include the following cdn in our header.ejs file. 

```
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.2.13/semantic.min.css
```

I am adding a simple navigation in the header.

#### header.ejs

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Mosques around the World</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.2.13/semantic.min.css">
</head>
<body>
     <div class="ui fixed inverted menu">
         <div class="ui container">
             <div class="header item">
                 <i class="large world icon"></i>Mosques
             </div>
             <a href="/" class="item">Home</a>
             <a href="/mosques/new" class="item">New Mosque</a>
         </div>
     </div>
```

Here is how it looks.

![gdp per capita](/img/nodejs/7.png){: .center-image}
*figure 7: we need to fix the problem of margin*

The text need to move a bit below. That means we need to increase the margin to `container` class. This need to be done through custom `css`. To do that, we us adopt good practice and create a folder `/public/stylesheets` and place `app.css` file inside it.

```
baqi:mosques abaqi$ mkdir public
baqi:mosques abaqi$ mkdir public/stylesheets
baqi:mosques abaqi$ touch public/stylesheets/app.css
```
And then introduce the margin in the css file.

#### app.css

```css
.container.main{
    margin-top: 7.0em;
}
```

In order for this to work, we need to do two things:

1.incorporate this file in the header.ejs file

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/stylesheets/app.css">
```

2.make the app use the `public` directory as our static asset folder.

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

Now we have a better page.

*figure 8: custom css*

## MongoDB

After building the skeleton, let us start including our mongoDB stuff. I assume you installed it in your environment. Make sure the deamon is running and that when you type `mongo` in the terminal you end us in the mongo console. 

Once installed, you need to install `mongoose` for express.

```
baqi:mosques abaqi$ npm install mongoose --save
```
Then make `app.js` have it.

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.use(express.static('public'));

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mosques_app', {useMongoClient: true});
//rest of the file
```

Next, we need to define the schema, and create a Mosque object in the `app.js` file. As you can see, my mosques will have a name, image url, location, a short description, when it was built, and when this mosque entered into the database (which is defaulted to the time of creation).

```javascript
var mosqueSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    image: String,
    location: String,
    description: String,
    established: String,
    created: {type: Date, default: Date.now}
});

var Mosque = mongoose.model("Mosque", mosqueSchema);
```

Just as a starter, let us create the first two mosques.

```javascript
Mosque.create({
	name: "Zaid Mosque",
    image: "https://source.unsplash.com/ERLAcTp-8MQ",
    location: "Abd Dhabi, Emirates",
    description: "The Grand Mosque was constructed between 1996 and 2007. It was designed by Syrian architect Yousef Abdelky",
    established: "2007",
});

Mosque.create({
	name: "Medina Mosque",
    image: "https://source.unsplash.com/jQUB81i93po",
    location: "Medina, Saudi Arabia",
    description: "The most important mosoque after Makkah. Built by Prophet of Islam. It has beautiful greem dome on top of the grave of Prophet.",
    established: "580AD"
});
```

Let us make sure it was created. Log to `mongo` console and follow the commands: `show dbs`, `use mosques_app`, `show collections`, `db.mosques.find()`.

```
baqi:mosques abaqi$ mongo
MongoDB shell version v3.4.10

"name" : "Zaid Mosque", 
"image" : "https://source.unsplash.com/ERLAcTp-8MQ", 
"location" : "Abd Dhabi, Emirates", 
"description" : "The Grand Mosque was constructed between 1996 and 2007. It was designed by Syrian architect Yousef Abdelky", 
"established" : "2007", 
"created" : ISODate("2017-12-17T12:20:14.401Z"), 
"__v" : 0 }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5a3751286b994671f09c363b"), "name" : "Medina Mosque", "image" : "https://source.unsplash.com/jQUB81i93po", "location" : "Medina, Saudi Arabia", "description" : "The most important mosoque after Makkah. Built by Prophet of Islam. It has beautiful greem dome on top of the grave of Prophet.", "established" : "580AD", "created" : ISODate("2017-12-18T05:24:56.578Z"), "__v" : 0 }
```

## Show Route

Now let me revisit the `/mosques` show route and bring the data from mongo database. To do that we need to use `Mosque.find` method as follows.

```javascript
app.get('/mosques', function(req,res){
	Mosque.find({}, function(err,mosques){
	if(err){
 	console.log('error:');
 	console.log(err);
 	} else {
 	res.render('index', {mosques: mosques});
 	}
	});
});
```

Let us present these two mosques in a nice format in the `index.ejs` utilizing semantic-UI features. 

#### index.ejs

```html
{% raw %}
<% include ./partials/header %>
<div class="ui main text container">
    <div class="ui huge header">Mosques Around the World</div>
    <div class="ui top attached segment">
        <div class="ui divided items">
             <% mosques.forEach(function(mosque){%>
                <div class="item">
                    <div class="image">
                        <img src="<%=mosque.image%>">
                    </div>
                    <div class="content">
                        <a class="header" href="/mosques/<%=mosque._id%>"><%=mosque.name%></a>
                        <div class="meta">
                            <span><%=mosque.created.toDateString()%></span> | Established <span><%=mosque.established%></span>
                        </div>
                        <div class="description">
                            <p><%-mosque.description.substring(0,100)%>...</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="extra">
                            <a class="ui floated basic violet button" href="/mosques/<%=mosque._id%>">Read More <i class="right chevron icon"></i></a>
                        </div>                  
                    </div>
                </div>
            <%});%>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<% include ./partials/footer %>
{% endraw %}
```

Few points to note: We are looping through the mosques data using `forEach` function in javascript. Since the description is long, we are using `substring(0,100)` to only include the first 100 characters. Note that `<%- ... %>` allows the text to apply any html tags within. Finally note that `.toDateString()` presents dates in a more readable format. 

![gdp per capita](/img/nodejs/9-show.png){: .center-image}
*figure 9: Show page polished*


## Show detailed page route

Now we move to the `/mosques/:id` route, where we need to show full page of a particular mosque retrieved by its id in the mongo database. 

Here is the code.

```javascript
app.get('/mosques/:id', function(req,res){
	Mosque.findById(req.params.id, function(err,foundMosque){
		if(err)
			{console.log(err);
			    res.redirect('/mosques');
			} 
		else {
			res.render('show', {mosque: foundMosque})
		}
	});
});
```
Note how we use `Mosque.findById()` and pass ID from the url. Here is how format our `show.ejs` file.

#### show.ejs

```html
{% raw %}<% include ./partials/header %>
<div class="ui main text container segment">
    <div class="ui huge header"><%=mosque.name%></div>
    <div class="ui top attached">
        <div class="item">
            <img class="ui centered image rounded" src="<%=mosque.image%>">
            <div class="content">
                <div class="meta">
                            <span><%=mosque.created.toDateString()%></span> | Established <span><%=mosque.established%></span>
                        </div>
                <div class="description"><%-mosque.description%></div>
                <form id="delete" action="/mosques/<%=mosque._id%>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
                    <button class="ui basic red button">Delete</button>
                </form> 
                <a class="ui basic green button" href="/mosques/<%=mosque._id%>/edit">Edit</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<% include ./partials/footer %> {% endraw %}
```

We borrowed many styling arrangements from the previously seen index page. We have added buttons for edit and delete which we will talk about later. The important point is to see how to pass delete route in the form of a `form` which I will discuss in the next section. 

```html
{% raw %}<form id="delete" action="/mosques/<%=mosque._id%>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
                    <button class="ui basic red button">Delete</button>
</form> {% endraw %}
```

Here is our page:

![gdp per capita](/img/nodejs/10-a.png){: .center-image}
*figure 10-a: Show detailed page- we have to align the two buttons*

Note how the `delete` button is taking the entire line. In order to bring the `edit` button in the same line, we need to add the following css code to the delete button through its id `#delete`.

```css
#delete {
    display: inline;
}
```
 
![gdp per capita](/img/nodejs/10-b.png){: .center-image}
*figure 10-b: Show detailed page - much better!*

## Ladies and gentlemen, here comes `forms`

With forms a new set of installations and configurations need to be done.

First we need to install `body-parser` to enable extracting data from form, also we need `express-sanitizer` to prevent inserting harmful codes through forms. Finally, we also need `method-override` to allow creating DELETE and PUT routes as we will see. 

```
baqi:mosques abaqi$ npm install body-parser method-override express-sanitizer --save
```
Then we configure our app.js to use these packages. 

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var expressSanitizer = require('express-sanitizer');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var methodOverride = require('method-override');

mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;

app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:true}));
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));
app.use(expressSanitizer());
...
...
```

## The Edit route (`/mosques/:id/edit`)

First we create the `get` route as follows.

```javascript
app.get('/mosques/:id/edit', function(req,res){
    Mosque.findById(req.params.id, function(err,foundMosque){
		if(err)
			{console.log(err);
			    res.redirect('/mosques');
			} 
		else {
			res.render('edit', {mosque: foundMosque});
		}
	});
});
```

Then, we go and create the `edit.ejs` page which will contain our form.

#### edit.ejs

```html
{%raw%}<%include ./partials/header %>

<div class="ui main text container segment">
    <div class="ui huge header">Edit "<%=mosque.name%>"</div>
    <form class="ui form" action="/mosques/<%=mosque._id%>?_method=PUT" method="POST">
        <div class="field">
            <label>Name</label>
            <input type="text" name="mosque[name]" value="<%=mosque.name%>">
        </div>
        <div class="field">
            <label>Image</label>
            <input type="text" name="mosque[image]" value="<%=mosque.image%>">
        </div>
        <div class="field">
            <label>Image</label>
            <input type="text" name="mosque[established]" value="<%=mosque.established%>">
        </div>
        <div class="field">
            <label>Mosque Description</label>
            <textarea name="mosque[description]"><%=mosque.description%></textarea>
        </div>
    
    
    <input type="submit" class="ui violet basic button">
</form>
</div>
<%include ./partials/footer %>{%endraw%}
```

Note how we passed `PUT` method through method overriding.

```html
<form class="ui form" action="/mosques/<%=mosque._id%>?_method=PUT" method="POST">
```

Now, let us create the `put` route in our app.js file.

```javascript
app.put('/mosques/:id', function(req,res){
    req.body.mosque.description=req.sanitize(req.body.mosque.description);
    Mosque.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body.mosque, function(err, updateMosque){
        if(err){
            res.redirect('/mosques');
        } else {
            res.redirect('/mosques/'+req.params.id);
        }
    });
});
```

Note how we sanitize the description field. 

```
req.body.mosque.description=req.sanitize(req.body.mosque.description);
```

Also, note the update command in mongoose `Mosque.findByIdAndUpdate()`. At the end when update is done successfully we redirect to the detailed show page again. Here are the pages in action.

## New Route 

Let us create a form to enter a new mosque reusing the same template we used previously for edit. 

#### new.ejs

```html
{%raw%}<% include ./partials/header %>
<div class="ui main text container segment">
    <div class="ui huge header">New Mosque</div>
    <form class="ui form" action="/mosques" method="POST">
        <div class="field">
            <label>Name</label>
            <input type="text" name=mosque[name]" placeholder="name">
        </div>
        <div class="field">
            <label>Image</label>
            <input type="text" name=mosque[image]" placeholder="image">
        </div>
        <div class="field">
            <label>Established Year</label>
            <input type="text" name=mosque[established]" placeholder="Established">
        </div>
        <div class="field">
            <label>Location</label>
            <input type="text" name=mosque[location]" placeholder="location">
        </div>
        <div class="field">
            <label>Mosque Description</label>
            <textarea name=mosque[description]" placeholder="your mosque description goes here"></textarea>
        </div>
    
    
    <input type="submit" class="ui violet basic button">
</form>
</div>
<% include ./partials/footer %>{%endraw%}
```

In the app.js we need to include the post route as follows.

```javascript
app.post("/mosques", function(req,res){
	req.body.mosque.description=req.sanitize(eq.body.mosque.description);

	// campgrounds.push(newCamp);
	Mosque.create(req.body.mosque, function(err,mosque){
	if (err){
		console.log('smth went wrong');
	} else {
		res.redirect('/mosques');
	}
	});
});
```

Here is the page view.

![](/img/nodejs/12-create.png){: .center-image}
*figure 12: create a new mosque (note I entered the established year wrong, no worries I can always edit and correct*

## Delete a mosque

We have seen in the `show.ejs` file how we incorporated the delete form as a button:

```html
<form id="delete" action="/mosques/<%=mosque._id%>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
                    <button class="ui basic red button">Delete</button>
                </form> 
```

All we need is to include a `delete` route in our app.js as below.

```javascript
app.delete('/mosques/:id', function(req,res){
    Mosque.findByIdAndRemove(req.params.id, function(err){
        if(err){
            res.redirect('/mosques');
        } else {
            res.redirect('/mosques');
        }
    })
});
```

## Conclusion

In a later post, I have to include further enhancements like user authentication and deployment. For now I summarize the RESTful methods given in the table above but inserting another column on mongoDB methods.


| **URL** | **HTTP Verb** |  **Action**|  **Mongoose Methods** |
|------------|-------------|------------| ----------------------|
| /mosques/         | GET       | index  | Mosque.find()
| /mosques/new         | GET       | new   | N/A
| /mosques          | POST      | create   | Mosque.create()
| /mosques/:id      | GET       | show       | Mosque.findById()
| /mosques/:id/edit | GET       | edit       | Mosque.findById()
| /mosques/:id      | PATCH/PUT | update    | Mosque.findByIdAndUpdate()
| /mosques/:id      | DELETE    | destroy  | Mosque.findByIdAndRemove()
