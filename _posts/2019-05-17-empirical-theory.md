Studying the history of Western thoughts are indeed studying a drowning man trying to cling to a straw only to discover that it can not hold him, and then move to another straw in the perpetual drama of thought and a contradicting anti-thought battle. 

The European mind emancipated from the shackles of Church and had to fill the void the Church left in running various systems that run the society in politics, economics, moral and personal transactions. 

There was a high `demand` for solutions, and any solution as long as it was not coming from Churchmen. 

When Newton put forward some mechanical law to explain how nature works, the European society took such laws to great distances (which Newton might have never thought of) and started to derive unwarranted implications from these laws only to satisfy inner desire to revenge anything Divine. So, now everything works like a clock and no need for a God to hold heaven and earth from collapsing one on the other. Everything under this law looks like `Absolute` and fine-tuned to work on its own as the clock works on its own in an exact way. We might need the clock-maker to make the clock, but now that it is working, we do not need him anymore. Thus the diests though. 

In Quran 35:41:

> God holds the heavens and the earth, lest they fall apart. And were they to fall apart, there is none to hold them together except He. He is Most Clement, Most Forgiving.

It is only many many years later in 1915 that Einstein came to suggest otherwise and say that everything is not absolute rather `relative.` Again, immediately European mind shifted gear and moved from one extreme to another and started to feel skeptical about the surrounding and got frustrated and as usual took Einstein's theories to the realm of moral and ethics and asserted that morality is also relative. This tendency to take an empirical theory or hypothesis to the world of morals, politics, sociology, and culture had a very adverse effect on the world and had created lots of extremism. Modern Art now rejected any absolute beauty dictated by classical and traditional schools. Even the text is deprived of authors intention. Everything is relative, and let the author die, but his/her writing remains floating in the air and let the individual reader assign whatever meaning he or she wants to. What craziness! 

Historian Paul Johnson gets it exactly right as he describes the cultural impact of Einstein's theories:

"Is was as though the spinning globe had been taken off its axis and cast adrift in a universe which no longer conformed to usual standards of measurement. At the beginning of the 1920s, the belief began to circulate, for the first time at a popular level, that there were no longer any absolutes: of time and space, of good and evil, of knowledge, above all of value. Mistakenly but perhaps inevitably, relativity became confused with relativism." ([source](https://albertmohler.com/2015/12/07/relativity-moral-relativism-and-the-modern-age)). 

It is very natural that when a man wants to proceed without the guidance of God, he ought to oscillate from thought and its contradicting thought is a perpetual swing of confusion â€” only resorting to the Divine message that brings equilibrium and happiness to the quests of soul. 

Quran 50:5:

> But they denied the truth when it has come to them, so they are in a confused state.
