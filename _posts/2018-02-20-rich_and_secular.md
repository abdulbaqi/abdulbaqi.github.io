Norris and Inglehart in their 2004 book [Sacred and Secular](https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Secular-Religion-Worldwide-Cambridge/dp/1107648378) proposed that secularism prevails more in affluent societies because these societies experience existential security and take security for granted, and hence they do not need to resort to religion to comfort them at times of insecurities in their life. Whereas, in the developing and poor countries people are constantly under threats of physical, social and personal vulnerabilities, and hence, need to resort to religion as a comfort factor. In other words, affluence and secularization go together. They tested this hypothesis against data from the [World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp) in the period 1981-2001. 

I found such observation very naive and undermines the essence of security and the intrinsic human need towards spirituality. No matter how an individual or a society is rich in material terms, his/her heart and soul remains looking forward to submitting to Allah. Man is hardwired to be poor and in need of divinity and spirituality. Nothing can quench the inner thirst for submission to a great power. Many have erred in identifying the true God, but nevertheless, human journey since inception is basically a journey in search of such deity. 

Read for example, verse [15 of Sura Fatir (35)](https://quran.com/35/15)

>O mankind, you are those in need of Allah, while Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.

It is very well-known fact that many celebrities attempt suicide after they reach the apex of material affluence but feel dryness in their spirituality. The typical problem of Norris and Inglehart is that they mixed-up between money and happiness. 

Read for example in Quran [16:97](https://quran.com/16/97) how the religious is rewarded with a 'happy life'.

>Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward [in the Hereafter] according to the best of what they used to do.

..and read the contrasting picture in [20:124](https://quran.com/20/124) of how the 'secular' is doomed to suffer from miserable life

>And whoever turns away from My remembrance - indeed, he will have a depressed life, and We will gather him on the Day of Resurrection blind."
