In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.

*The infidels of Makkah asked the Prophet “O Muhammad, tell us the lineage of your Lord”, this chapter was revealed as an answer. *

## 1. Say, “He is Allah, the One.
Allah is One who has no similarity. He needs no helper or assistant. No one other than Allah deserved the absolute meaning of One except him, because He is the perfect One in his attributes and deeds.
## 2. Allah, the Absolute.
All creatures rush towards Him for help. He is the Master who reached the apex of sovereignty. He does not need to eat, drink, or digest food. He is the one remaining.
## 3. He begets not, nor was He begotten.
He has no son, no father, no wife
## 4. And there is none comparable to Him.”
He is the owner of all things, and hence no creation can come close in resembling Him. Exalted be He, the One Allah.
